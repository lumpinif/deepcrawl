description: Create, rotate, and manage Deepcrawl API keys for secure integrations.

API keys authenticate any non-session client (SDKs, REST calls, automation scripts). The dashboard gives you full lifecycle management—create, rotate, disable, and audit usage—without touching the database.

## Where API keys are used
- **Dashboard playground:** runs on server-side sessions but can reuse API keys for persistent server integrations.
- **SDK & REST clients:** include the key in either the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header or the `x-api-key` header. One header is enough.
- **Automation platforms:** copy the key into CI/CD secrets, Zapier, Airtable scripts, etc., to trigger crawls without user logins.

## Generate a new key

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the dashboard at <Link href="https://deepcrawl.dev/app/api-keys">API Keys</Link> and click <code>New API Key</code>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Choose an expiration (never, 30/60/90 days, 6 months, 1 year) and name the key so teammates recognize its purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After creation, copy the full token. This is the only time the dashboard shows the entire key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Lost keys cannot be recovered—create a new one and update consumers.

### CLI and local development

<Tabs items={['Shell', 'Next.js (.env.local)', 'CI provider']}>
  <Tab>

```bash
export DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY="dc_sk_live_your_key"
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```dotenv
# .env.local (server only)
DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY=dc_sk_live_your_key
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

Add the key as a secret (e.g., `DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY`) inside GitHub Actions, Vercel, or Cloudflare Workers. Inject it at runtime and never commit it to git.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage existing keys

<Tabs items={['Rename & notes', 'Disable temporarily', 'Rotate or delete']}>
  <Tab>

  - Use the row menu to edit the display name after creation. Helpful for tracking ownership or scope.
  - Add descriptions in your team docs referencing the dashboard name so rotations are painless.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  - Toggle a key to “Disabled” to pause access without losing the secret.
  - Ideal when investigating suspicious activity or preparing a planned maintenance window.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  - Delete keys you no longer need; the dashboard warns that the action is irreversible.
  - When rotating, create a replacement key first, update all consumers, confirm traffic shifts, then delete the old one.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using API keys in code

```ts
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

const deepcrawl = new DeepcrawlApp({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY as string,
});

export async function run() {
  const markdown = await deepcrawl.getMarkdown('https://example.com');
  return markdown;
}
```

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.deepcrawl.dev/read?url=https://example.com"
```
