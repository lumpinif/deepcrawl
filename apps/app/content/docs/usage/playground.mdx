description: Learn how to drive the Deepcrawl dashboard, configure options, and validate operations before automating them.

Deepcrawl ships with a production-grade dashboard that mirrors everything exposed by the API and SDK. The playground lets you experiment with `getMarkdown`, `readUrl`, or `extractLinks`, tune advanced options, and inspect responses side-by-side before wiring them into code.

</Callout>

## Before you begin
- Sign in at <Link href="https://deepcrawl.dev/app">Deepcrawl dashboard</Link> using the organization credentials you created in the Quick Start.
- Create or reuse an API key from <Link href="https://deepcrawl.dev/app/api-keys">API Keys</Link>. Dashboard calls run server-side, so the key stays in Deepcrawl’s backend—no need to paste it every time.
- Optional: Inspect activity logs details, API keys, or account management supporting multiple user sessions.

## Dashboard layout
- **Operation switcher:** Choose `Get Markdown`, `Read URL`, or `Extract Links`. Each operation remembers its latest options, so you can jump between experiments without losing state.
- **Prompt bar:** Paste a target URL, hit the operation button, and watch execution time badges confirm when the run finishes or retries.
- **Options toolbar:** Hover over the icons (format, links, markdown, processor, cache, metrics) to open contextual menus. The `+` button expands a full summary panel with every toggle explained.
- **Response workspace:** A tabbed viewer renders markdown, tree maps, and raw JSON. Metadata and metrics cards sit alongside copy/share buttons so you can export results instantly.

## Run your first operation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Pick the operation that matches your goal. `Get Markdown` is fastest for LLMs-favored markdown content only with minimal token cost, `Read URL` adds metadata and structured context, and `Extract Links` builds a crawlable map.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Paste a full URL. The input highlights errors and links to cached execution time while the request is in flight.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    (Optional) Open the toolbar menus to adjust output format, caching, or link handling. Defaults are safe for most sites and can be adjusted to your needs.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Submit and review the response panel. Drill into **Markdown**, **Tree**, or **Raw** tabs, copy the payload, or retry with a single click if the source throttled the request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn" title="About response times">
The time you see in the browser includes the round-trip from your device to the dashboard and then to the Deepcrawl API. The actual **API response time** is typically much **faster**. Check the **Metrics** card in the response panel to see the true server-side execution time, which reflects what your production code will experience when calling the API directly.

## Configure options for your use case

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion value="content-format" title="Content format toggles">
    - Toggle markdown, metadata, cleaned HTML, raw HTML, or robots.txt fetches. `Extract Links` adds sitemap XML and full tree generation.
    - When building sitemap-aware agents, enable both **Tree** and **Metadata** so every node carries titles, descriptions, and canonical URLs.
    - For minimal token costs, disable raw HTML and metadata so only condensed markdown comes back.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="markdown" title="Markdown converter">
    - Available on `Get Markdown`. Tune bullet markers, fenced vs. indented code blocks, newline compression, inline links, and base64 image retention.
    - Prefer the native parser for performance, but switch it off if the source uses edge-case HTML the fallback handles better.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="links" title="Link extraction filters">
    - Only visible on `Extract Links`. Include external domains, media assets, or strip query strings depending on how your agents crawl.
    - Provide newline-separated patterns (regex or path fragments) to exclude login areas or marketing parameters from the graph.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="processor" title="Cleaning processor">
    - Swap between **Cheerio Reader** (default) and the Deepcrawl **HTML Rewriter**. The rewriter is tuned for GitHub and other script-heavy sites.
    - Useful when the default output misses dynamic content—switch processors and re-run to compare.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="cache" title="Cache behaviour">
    - Enable caching to reuse recent crawls. Adjust TTL (seconds) to balance freshness and cost; the default maps to roughly 2-4 days.
    - Reset to defaults anytime. Cached hits show up instantly in the response metrics card.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion value="metrics" title="Performance metrics">
    - Toggle timing output for `Read URL` or `Extract Links`. Metrics include total duration, processing stages, and cache status.
    - Use this when benchmarking agent workflows or comparing processors.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Playground recipes

<Tabs items={['LLM prompt prep', 'Agent site audit', 'Link intelligence']}>
  <Tab>
    - Operation: `Get Markdown`
    - Enable markdown (default) and inline links; disabled metadata and raw HTML for the leanest tokens.
    - Keep cache on so repeat prompts stay instant while you iterate on prompt engineering.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Operation: `Read URL`
    - Turn on metadata, cleaned HTML, and metrics.
    - Combine with the **Logs** page to inspect operation details or errors, or export the full JSON when debugging agents.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    - Operation: `Extract Links`
    - Include external links or media links when mapping knowledge bases that span multiple domains.
    - Provide folder-first or alphabetical order file-tree like structure patterns for query-heavy tracking URLs, and enable tree metadata so agents see titles plus hierarchy depth. Imagine a specially tailored navigation map for agents to navigate a website.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Inspecting results
- Use the **Markdown** tab to preview cleaned content exactly as your LLM would consume it. Copy the snippet or download via the action buttons.
- Switch to **Tree** to browse the hierarchical view generated by `Extract Links`. Every node carries quick-open and copy controls.
- **Raw** response displays the JSON contract—the same structure returned by the REST API and SDK.
- Metadata and metrics cards highlight request IDs, cache status, and timing so you can reproduce or escalate issues quickly.
- Every playground state is encoded in the URL (thanks to [nuqs](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs)), so copy the address bar to share a preconfigured run—operation, toggles, and URL included.

## Related dashboard views
- **Logs:** the home page prefetches recent runs. Filter by status, endpoint, or time range, then export markdown, JSON, or tree payloads.
- **API Keys:** generate scoped keys, rotate credentials, and assign usage notes for teammates.
- **Account & devices:** manage passkeys, active sessions, and organization memberships.
