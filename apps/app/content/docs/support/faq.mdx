This page will collect common questions and point to relevant guides and references.

## General

### Is Deepcrawl free to use?

Yes. Deepcrawl is 100% free and open for anyone to deploy. Follow the self-hosting guide to provision the Next.js app, Workers, and SDK locally or on your own infrastructure.

### How do I install the SDK?

Run `pnpm add deepcrawl` (or `npm install` / `yarn add`). Then create a server-side client:

```typescript
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

export const deepcrawl = new DeepcrawlApp({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY
});
```

### Where do I find the latest types and schemas?

Types live under `deepcrawl/types`, Zod schemas under `deepcrawl/schemas`, and the raw oRPC contracts in `packages/contracts`. The TypeScript reference docs walk through each export.

### Why do requests fail in the browser?

The SDK is server-only. Use Next.js Server Actions or API routes to proxy requests; never expose `DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY` to the client.

## Development

### Which command validates formatting and types?

`pnpm check` runs Biome formatting, linting, and `pnpm typecheck`. Run it at the repo root before committing.

### How do I reset my local Workers secrets?

Re-copy the templates:

```bash
cp apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars
cp apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars
```

Then rerun `wrangler secret put` for any values you store in Cloudflare.

### What if my dev environment cannot reach Redis or KV?

Check the bindings in `wrangler.jsonc` and ensure Upstash/Cloudflare credentials are present. For local-only testing, switch to in-memory fallbacks defined in `packages/auth` and `packages/contracts`.
