We always welcome contributions!

## Local Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (Node.js 20+ required).
3. Copy environment templates and fill secrets:
   - `cp apps/app/.env.example apps/app/.env.local`
   - `cp apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars`
   - `cp apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars`
4. Run `pnpm -C apps/app dev` for the dashboard, add `dev:workers` when you need Worker proxies.

## Development Workflow

- Keep changes scoped: update contracts, app, workers, and SDK together when the feature spans layers.
- Use `pnpm dev` to run the whole workspace, `pnpm build` for a production build, and `pnpm check` before pushing.
- Write tests near the code (Vitest for SDK, integration tests inside apps/workers as needed).
- Prefer reusable utilities in `packages/*`; export them through the package index.

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript-first: strict configs from `packages/typescript-config`.
- Formatting: Biome with 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas.
- React: PascalCase component files, `use-*.ts` for hooks, kebab-case for other files.
- Resolve lint warnings—do not silence rules unless discussed.

Biome runs in `pnpm check`, but you can run `pnpm biome check --write` inside any package if you need to auto-fix formatting before committing.

## Commit Style

We use scoped Conventional Commits: `<scope>[:subscope]:<type> message`.

Examples:

- `app:feat add job status badge to dashboard`
- `pkg:ui:fix correct Button loading state`
- `workers:v0:chore add queue retries`
- `scripts:ref log slow routes`

Guidelines:

- Subject ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood.
- Reference issues (`#123`) or follow-up notes in the body when relevant.
- Squash commits per PR if requested, but keep messages descriptive during development.

## Pull Requests

- Link the corresponding issue and describe the change with screenshots for UI updates.
- Confirm `pnpm check` passes—this aggregates Biome formatting, linting, and TypeScript checks—and mention any additional tests run.
- Flag breaking changes or migrations in the PR summary.
- Request a review early if architectural decisions need consensus.

## Issues and Triage

- Use the issue templates to report bugs or propose enhancements.
- Label requests with area scopes (`app`, `workers`, `pkg`, `docs`) to help routing.
- Assign yourself before starting work to avoid duplicate efforts.
