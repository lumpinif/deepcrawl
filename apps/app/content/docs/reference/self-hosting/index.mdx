This page will include instructions for self-hosting Deepcrawl.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- `pnpm` for workspace commands
- Wrangler CLI for Cloudflare Worker deployments
- Access to the project repo: [https://github.com/lumpinif/deepcrawl](https://github.com/lumpinif/deepcrawl)

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run this inside the repo root to install shared packages, the Next.js dashboard, and worker dependencies.

## 2. Prepare Environment Templates

Copy the provided templates so you can edit them locally:

```bash
cp apps/app/.env.example apps/app/.env.local
cp apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars
cp apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars.example apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars
```

These files include placeholders for the API key, base URL, and Wrangler-specific tokens.

## 3. Fill In Secrets

Edit each file and set the required values:

- `apps/app/.env.local`: `DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPCRAWL_BASE_URL`
- `apps/workers/auth/.dev.vars`: Worker API key, JWT secrets, session salts
- `apps/workers/v0/.dev.vars`: Worker API key, webhook signing secret, storage bindings

Keep secrets out of version controlâ€”these templates are ignored by Git.

## 4. Run the Next.js Dashboard

```bash
pnpm -C apps/app dev
```

This boots the dashboard with the server-side API client. Confirm the environment variables load correctly by signing in and running a sample crawl.

## 5. Run Workers Locally

```bash
pnpm -C apps/app dev:workers
```

This command launches the dashboard and proxies the Workers so you can test auth flows end-to-end.

## 6. Deploy Workers With Wrangler

Before deploying, log into Cloudflare and ensure the secrets above are set via `wrangler secret put`.

```bash
pnpm -C apps/workers/auth deploy
pnpm -C apps/workers/v0 deploy
```

Each script uses the corresponding `wrangler.jsonc` configuration and operator secrets. Confirm the deployed routes respond as expected.
