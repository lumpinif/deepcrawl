## Single source of truth

This deployment supports template-friendly branding via a single environment
variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_NAME="FasterCrawl"
```

## What it changes

- Dashboard site name and logo text
- Email template copy and subjects (Better Auth emails)
- API surface display (OpenAPI title and server description)
- Scrape request `User-Agent` (keeps browser-like UA and appends a brand token)

## What it does not change

- Package names (e.g. `deepcrawl`, `@deepcrawl/*`)
- Official SDK API (`DeepcrawlApp`, `npm i deepcrawl`, etc.)
