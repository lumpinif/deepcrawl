All the TypeScript types and schemas for the Deepcrawl API.

## Guides

- **Install the TypeScript SDK**: Add `deepcrawl` to your project with `pnpm add deepcrawl`, then import `DeepcrawlApp` to start making typed API calls.
- **Configure a typed client**: Create a single server-side client with your API key and reuse it across Server Actions, Workers, or backend services.
- **Use generated schemas**: Import schema exports from `deepcrawl/schemas` to validate request payloads and response data with Zod.
- **Share contract types**: Reuse the definitions in `deepcrawl/types` to keep front-end and worker code in sync without duplicating interfaces.
