title: Export Response
description: Export the response data from a specific operation.
---

Download the payload behind any log entry without rerunning the crawl. The
worker reconstructs the original response and converts it to a convenient
format for reports or debugging.

## Endpoint

- `GET https://api.deepcrawl.dev/logs/export?id={requestId}&format={format}`
- Requires authentication (same as the other logs endpoints).

## Formats

| Format | When to use | Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| `json` | Default view of the response object | Works for every endpoint. Returns the full discriminated union. |
| `markdown` | You only need rendered markdown content | Supported for `read-getMarkdown` and successful `read-readUrl` calls that generated markdown. |
| `links` | You need the structured links tree | Works for `links-getLinks` and `links-extractLinks` responses that included `tree: true`. |

## Request Options – `ExportResponseOptions`

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/logs/index.ts"
  name="ExportResponseOptions"
/>

<Callout type="warning">
  Logs created via `read-getMarkdown` store the payload as a plain string. The
  export endpoint always returns that string, even if you request `json` or
  `links` format.
</Callout>

## Example Request

```bash
curl "https://api.deepcrawl.dev/logs/export?id=log_456&format=markdown" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY"
```

### TypeScript SDK

```typescript
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

const dc = new DeepcrawlApp({ apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY! });

const params: ExportResponseOptions = {
  id: 'log_456',
  format: 'markdown'
};
const result: ExportResponseOutput = await dc.exportResponse(params);

console.log(result);
```

## Response – `ExportResponseOutput`

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/logs/index.ts"
  name="ExportResponseOutput"
/>

## Sample Outputs

- `format=json`

  ```json
  {
    "path": "read-readUrl",
    "success": true,
    "markdown": "# Example Page",
    "metadata": { "title": "Example Page" }
  }
  ```

- `format=links`

  ```json
  {
    "href": "https://example.com",
    "children": [
      { "href": "https://example.com/about", "text": "About" }
    ]
  }
  ```

- `format=markdown`

  ```markdown
  # Example Page

  Deepcrawl extracted this markdown from https://example.com.
  ```

## Errors

- `400 INVALID_EXPORT_FORMAT` if a format is not supported for the log’s path.
- `404 NOT_FOUND` when the request ID does not belong to the authenticated account.
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED` for missing or invalid credentials.
