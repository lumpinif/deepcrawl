title: Get Links
description: Fetch extracted links for a page via GET /links.
---

`getLinks` is the identical companion to `extractLinks` but with quick access support directly from your browser URL bar. It shares the same schema but is accessible through a GET request, making it ideal for quick lookups or copy-paste-ready results where you don't need to POST a body.

<Callout type="success" title="No prerequisites required">
Link extraction works by parsing the actual HTML content of your target page—no sitemap.xml, robots.txt, or other configuration files needed. Deepcrawl intelligently discovers links by analyzing the page structure, making it work on any website regardless of their SEO setup.

## How does `Links Tree` look like in real usage?

This abbreviated snapshot comes from a real crawl of `hono.dev`, if you are logged into the dashboard already [click this url](https://api.deepcrawl.dev/links?url=hono.dev) from your browser to see the raw response, or you can try it out from [here in playground](http://deepcrawl.dev/app?op=extractLinks&url=hono.dev).

## When to use this endpoint
- You want to preview link extraction results without constructing a POST payload.
- You’re integrating from environments that only allow GET (e.g., low-code tooling, browser tabs using cookie auth).
- You don’t need to modify request options beyond query parameters.

For deeper customization (tree generation, exclusion patterns, metadata, metrics), use [`extractLinks`](/docs/features/links/extractLinks).

## Request format

### REST (GET /links)
```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.deepcrawl.dev/links?url=https://example.com"
```
  - Optionally, add query parameters mirroring the POST options (tree, metadata, cleanedHtml, link extraction toggles, etc.).

### Node SDK - `getLinks()`
```ts
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

const deepcrawl = new DeepcrawlApp({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY as string,
});

const links = await deepcrawl.getLinks('https://example.com', {
  ...getLinksOptions,
});
```

- Responses default to the same structure as [`extractLinks`](/docs/features/links/extractLinks)—tree data when `tree=true`, otherwise only extracted links.

## Query parameters - `GetLinksOptions`

- Even though this is a GET request, the available fields align with `GetLinksOptions`. Send them as query parameters (e.g., `tree=true`, `metadata=true`, `includeExternal=false`).

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/links.ts"
  name="GetLinksOptions"
/>


## Response structure - `GetLinksResponse`

- This is a union of two shapes:
 
  1. `GetLinksResponseWithTree` (when `tree` is enabled in options) – includes a `tree` hierarchy you can traverse, and metadata is nested in the tree node.
  2. `GetLinksResponseWithoutTree` (when `tree` is false in options) – omits `tree`, returning only extracted links and metadata.

<Callout type="info" title="GetLinksResponse">

- `GetLinksResponseWithTree`
  <AutoTypeTable
    path="../../packages/contracts/src/links.ts"
    name="GetLinksResponseWithTree"
  />
- `GetLinksResponseWithoutTree`
  <AutoTypeTable
    path="../../packages/contracts/src/links.ts"
    name="GetLinksResponseWithoutTree"
  />

Type safely narrow by checking `if ('tree' in response && response.tree)` before reading the tree.
</Callout>

Example response:

- With tree:

```json
{
  requestId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  success: true,
  cached: false,
  targetUrl: "https://example.com",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  ancestors: ["https://example.com"],
  tree: {
    url: "https://example.com",
    name: "Home",
    lastUpdated: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
    metadata: { title: "Example", description: "..." },
    extractedLinks: { internal: [...], external: [...] },
    children: [...]
  }
}
```

- Without tree:

```json
{
  requestId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  success: true,
  cached: false,
  targetUrl: "https://example.com",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  title: "Example Website",
  description: "Welcome to our site",
  metadata: { title: "Example", description: "..." },
  extractedLinks: { internal: [...], external: [...] }
}
```

Errors use the shared schema:

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/types/src/routers/links/types.ts"
  name="LinksErrorResponse"
/>

## Tuning tips
- Combine the GET endpoint with the [Playground](/docs/usage/playground) for rapid iteration. Once satisfied, move to POST calls to leverage cached options.
- Use `includeExternal=true` when mapping third-party references; toggle `includeMedia` to catalog assets.
- Pair outputs with [`readUrl`](/docs/features/read/readUrl) to fetch detailed content for the most important links.

Need richer control? Jump to [`extractLinks`](/docs/features/links/extractLinks).
