title: Read URL
description: Capture full page context, metadata, and logs via the POST /read endpoint.
---

`readUrl` is Deepcrawl’s full-fidelity page fetcher. It returns structured metadata, cleaned/markdown/HTML variants, optional metrics, robots data, and more—perfect for agents that need the entire page context in one call.

## When to use this endpoint
- You need metadata, cleaned HTML, markdown, or robots manifest as `JSON` in addition to plain text.
- You want Deepcrawl to capture metrics and logging info for debugging or analytics.
- You plan to export or replay responses later via the logs API.

If you only need markdown, the lighter [`getMarkdown`](/docs/features/read/getMarkdown) endpoint is faster and cheaper on token cost for agent integration. For link trees or maps, use the [links endpoints](/docs/features/links).

## Request formats

### REST (POST /read)

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "https://api.deepcrawl.dev/read" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    ...readUrlOptions, // see below
  }'
```

- Authentication can be an API key header or session cookies from the dashboard.
- POST requests accept the full option set (see below); omit fields to fall back to defaults.

### Node SDK - `readUrl()`

```ts
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

const deepcrawl = new DeepcrawlApp({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY as string,
});

const result = await deepcrawl.readUrl('https://example.com', {
  ...readUrlOptions,
});

console.log(result.metadata?.title);
```

## Request body - `ReadUrlOptions`

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/read.ts"
  name="ReadUrlOptions"
/>

Highlights:
- Toggle `metadata`, `cleanedHtml`, `robots`, `sitemapXML`, or `metaFiles` depending on what the agent needs.
- Control fetch behavior via `fetchOptions` (headers, geo, user agent) and HTML processing using `cleaningProcessor`, `htmlRewriterOptions`, or `readerCleaningOptions`.
- Use `cacheOptions` and `metricsOptions` just like on the GET endpoint.

## Response structure - `ReadUrlResponse`

Successful responses include page metadata, content variants, metrics, and crawl diagnostics.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/read.ts"
  name="ReadUrlResponse"
/>

Errors follow the shared response schema and always include the request/target URL plus a timestamp.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/types/src/routers/read/types.ts"
  name="ReadErrorResponse"
/>

Example snippet:

```json
{
  requestId: "4c2fb3f1-56f1-4ad3-9e5d-1d9f9b6efabc",
  success: true,
  cached: true,
  targetUrl: "https://example.com",
  metadata: {
    title: "Example Domain",
    description: "This domain is for use in illustrative examples." 
  },
  markdown: "# Example Domain...",
  metrics: {
    "readableDuration": "0.32s",
    "durationMs": 320
  }
}
```

## Logs & observability
- Every POST is logged under `read-readUrl` with full request/response payloads.
- Use the dashboard or Logs API to export JSON snapshots for debugging or downstream processing.
- Rate limiting errors use `RATE_LIMITED`; respect the `retryAfter` hint or enable caching to reduce load.

## Tips
- Prototype in the [Playground](/docs/usage/playground) to compare output combinations quickly.
- Share playground URLs to hand teammates a preconfigured run (`nuqs` keeps state in the link).
- Combine with the logs export endpoint to stream historical markdown or link data into your pipelines.

Looking for lighter payloads? Switch to [`getMarkdown`](/docs/features/read/getMarkdown) or pair with [links endpoints](/docs/features/links) for sitemap navigation.
