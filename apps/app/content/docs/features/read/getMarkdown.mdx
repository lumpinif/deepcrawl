title: Get Markdown
description: Turn any URL into clean markdown via the GET /read endpoint.
---

The `getMarkdown` endpoint converts a single web page into markdown that Large Language Models and humans can consume with minimal noise. It is ideal for quick pulls, cached refreshes, or building prompt-ready snippets.

## When to use this endpoint
- You only need the markdown representation of a page (no metadata or link tree).
- The page is public and can be handled by Deepcrawlâ€™s scraping pipeline.
- You want cached requests to return quickly on repeated calls.

For richer page context (metadata, cleaned HTML, robots, metrics), use [`readUrl`](/docs/features/read/readUrl). For multi-page link maps, see [links endpoints](/docs/features/links).

## Request formats

### REST

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.deepcrawl.dev/read?url=https://example.com"
```

- Authenticate with an API key header or dashboard session cookies.
- Responses are returned as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`.
- Add query parameters to control caching or markdown conversion (see options below).

### Node SDK

```ts
import { DeepcrawlApp } from 'deepcrawl';

const deepcrawl = new DeepcrawlApp({
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPCRAWL_API_KEY!,
});

const markdown = await deepcrawl.getMarkdown('https://example.com', {
  markdownConverterOptions: {
    useInlineLinks: true,
  },
});
```

## Query parameters - `GetMarkdownOptions`

<AutoTypeTable
  path="../../packages/contracts/src/read.ts"
  name="GetMarkdownOptions"
/>

Common tweaks:
- `cacheOptions.expirationTtl`: cache window in seconds (minimum 60).
- `cleaningProcessor`: choose `cheerio-reader` (default) or `html-rewriter` for GitHub-like pages.
- `markdownConverterOptions`: adjust bullet markers, inline links, data-image handling, etc.

## Response - `GetMarkdownResponse`

The GET endpoint returns markdown as a string:

```markdown
# Example Domain

This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.
```

If you need structured metadata or metrics, switch to the POST endpoint.

## Logs & monitoring
- Every call appears in the dashboard **Logs** with path `read-getMarkdown`.
- You can export the stored markdown later via the logs export endpoint.
- Rate limiting errors surface as `RATE_LIMITED`; retry after the suggested interval.

## Tips
- Combine with the [Playground](/docs/usage/playground) to test options before coding.
- Share full run configurations by copying the playground URL (state is encoded via `nuqs`).
- Use caching for pages that change infrequently to save on crawl time and rate limits.
