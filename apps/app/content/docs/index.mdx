<Callout type="info" title="tl;dr one-liner">
Deepcrawl is 100% free and open-source Firecrawl alternative with better performance and flexibility.
</Callout>

Deepcrawl is an open-source agents-oriented web page context extraction platform. It extracts cleaned markdown of page content, agent-favoured links tree and page metadata that LLMs can digest with minimal token cost to reduce context switching and hallucination. Open Source. Open Code.


## Why Deepcrawl exists
- Compress messy web pages into structured markdown that agents and humans can read.
- Map every link in a domain so workflows understand site topology before they browse.
- Offer type-safe, production-ready APIs and SDKs that feel native inside agent frameworks like `ai-sdk`.

## How the system is put together
- **Service pipeline:** Cloudflare Workers handle fetching, normalization, and link graph generation for each domain or URL.
- **Rendering outputs:** Specially tuned engines convert HTML into markdown tuned for LLM prompts, keeping context rich while trimming noise.
- **Developer toolchain:** The turborepo(monorepo) hosts shared packages, database modules, and scripts that keep the full stack consistent.

## What technologies make Deepcrawl possible
<Callout type="info">Shout out to all the awesome projects with remarkable maintainers and communities.</Callout>

- **[Hono](https://hono.dev):** Lightweight edge-first framework powering our worker routing and middleware.
- **[oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com):** Contract-first RPC layer that generates both OpenAPI REST endpoints and RPC methods exposed to SDK client from a single source.
- **[better-auth](https://better-auth.com):** All-powered enterprise-grade secure session and API key management so teams can ship without rolling their own auth stack.
- **[Next.js 15 App Router](https://nextjs.org):** Aggressively optimized dashboard combining with streaming routes and granular data fetching that manifests the best UI/UX industrial standards and stability.
- **[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com):** Global runtime for V8 runtime web scraping, caching, and rate limiting with minimal latency and cost control, along with service bindings for communication between workers and more in-coming services for more planed features.
- **[Zod v4](https://zod.dev):** Shared schema library that enforces type safety across workers, SDKs, and docs.
- **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query):** Advanced server-side prefetching and cache synchronization for fast dashboard interactions.
- **[nuqs](https://nuqs.47ng.com):** URL state serialization supports our advanced custom states management for best efficiency and user experience with shareable custom operation options by copying the URL.
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) + [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com):** Beautiful and accessible components system and modern design tokens for consistent UI.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team):** Type-safe data layer across both Neon PostgreSQL and Cloudflare D1 SQLite deployments for data persistence.
- **[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com) + [Cloudflare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv):** Rate-limiting and Layered caching strategy that balances hot-path performance with cost control.

## Ways to use Deepcrawl today
- **Developers:** Consume the APIs directly or integrate with the fully typed JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs for fast agent workflows.
- **Analysts & teams:** Use the Next.js 15 dashboard to run crawls, explore the API playground, review logs, and manage API keys without writing code.

## Deploy on your own terms
Deepcrawl ships with everything you need to self-host: deploy the dashboard to Vercel, the workers to Cloudflare, and you have a complete system without paid dependencies. Fork it, extend it, or plug it into your existing stackâ€”the licenses and tooling encourage customization.
