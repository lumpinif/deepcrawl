title: Why Choose Deepcrawl
description: Understand the strengths that make Deepcrawl the right platform for LLM-ready web crawling.
---

Deepcrawl turns web pages into clean, structured data for LLMs and humans. Fast, open-source, and built for production.

## Better performance by default
- **5-10x faster than alternatives** on standard HTML parsing—no headless browser overhead for simple content.
- Edge-native V8 Workers return responses in milliseconds with optimized parsers and smart caching.
- Dynamic cache controls reduce redundant crawls and handle bursty workflows gracefully.

## Optimized for AI workflows
- **Markdown-first output** removes ads, scripts, and boilerplate while preserving semantic structure.
- **Token-efficient formatting** cuts prompt costs without losing context.
- **Link tree intelligence** maps true site topology so agents plan next steps without sitemap.xml—potentially outperforming llms.txt.

## Worldwide edge infrastructure
- Cloudflare Workers run requests close to users globally, minimizing latency.
- Automatic retries recover from flaky sites without manual intervention.
- CDN-backed responses maintain consistent performance worldwide.

## Developer-first tooling
- **Lightweight TypeScript SDK** shares contracts, types, and schemas with the worker—playground parity from install.
- Typed error classes distinguish rate limits, validation issues, and upstream failures.
- Consistent REST and oRPC endpoints work across any runtime: curl, Python, serverless functions.
- Zod schemas plug directly into AI frameworks expecting structured outputs.

## Fits how your team works

<Tabs items={['Build with APIs', 'Operate with Dashboard']}>
  <Tab>

  - Call endpoints with bearer tokens or API keys from backends, serverless functions, or automation tools.
  - Stream markdown and link trees into AI frameworks like `ai-sdk`, LangChain, or custom planners.
  - Extend open contracts to enforce custom rate limits, headers, or metadata policies.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  - Next.js 16 dashboard with API playground, full options support, task history, and account management.
  - Built-in previews validate clean markdown before production deployment.
  - Access controls and audit logs track usage across teams.

## Type safety across every surface
- Shared OpenAPI, oRPC, and Zod schemas keep workers, dashboard, and SDK aligned.
- Inputs validate once and stay consistent from compile to runtime.
- Same contracts used to build Deepcrawl ship with the SDK.
