<br />
Deepcrawl is an open-source agents-oriented web page context extraction platform. It extracts cleaned markdown of page content, agent-favoured links tree and page metadata that LLMs can digest with minimal token cost to reduce context switching and hallucination. Open Source. Open Code.

## Why Deepcrawl exists
- Compress messy web pages into structured markdown that agents and humans can read.
- Map every link in a domain so workflows understand site topology before they browse.
- Offer type-safe, production-ready APIs and SDKs that feel native inside agent frameworks like `ai-sdk`.

## How the system is put together
- **Crawling pipeline:** Cloudflare Workers handle fetching, normalization, and link graph generation for each domain or URL.
- **Rendering outputs:** Engines convert HTML into markdown tuned for LLM prompts, keeping context rich while trimming noise.
- **Developer toolchain:** The monorepo hosts shared packages, database modules, and scripts that keep the full stack consistent.

## What technologies Deepcrawl is built on
<Callout type="info">Shout out to all the awesome projects that make Deepcrawl possible.</Callout>

- **Hono:** Lightweight edge-first framework powering our worker routing and middleware.
- **oRPC:** Contract-first RPC layer that generates both OpenAPI REST endpoints and RPC methods exposed to SDK client from a single source.
- **better-auth:** All-powered enterprise-grade secure session and API key management so teams can ship without rolling their own auth stack.
- **Next.js 15 App Router:** Aggressively optimized dashboard combining with streaming routes and granular data fetching that manifests the best UI/UX industrial standards and stability.
- **Cloudflare Workers:** Global runtime for V8 runtime web scraping, caching, and rate limiting with minimal latency and cost control, along with service bindings for communication between workers and more in-coming services for more planed features.
- **Zod v4:** Shared schema library that enforces type safety across workers, SDKs, and docs.
- **React Query:** Advanced server-side prefetching and cache synchronization for fast dashboard interactions.
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4:** Beautiful and accessible components system and modern design tokens for consistent UI.
- **Drizzle ORM:** Type-safe data layer across both Neon PostgreSQL and Cloudflare D1 SQLite deployments for data persistence.
- **Upstash Redis + Cloudflare KV:** Layered caching strategy that balances hot-path performance with cost control.

## Ways to use Deepcrawl today
- **Developers:** Consume the APIs directly or integrate with the fully typed JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs for fast agent workflows.
- **Analysts & teams:** Use the Next.js 15 dashboard to run crawls, explore the API playground, review logs, and manage API keys without writing code.

## Deploy on your own terms
Deepcrawl ships with everything you need to self-host: deploy the dashboard to Vercel, the workers to Cloudflare, and you have a complete system without paid dependencies. Fork it, extend it, or plug it into your existing stackâ€”the licenses and tooling encourage customization.
