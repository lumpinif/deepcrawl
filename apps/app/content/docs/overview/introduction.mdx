<br />
Deepcrawl is an open-source agents-oriented web page context extraction platform. It extracts cleaned markdown of page content, agent-favoured links tree and page metadata that LLMs can digest with minimal token cost to reduce context switching and hallucination. Open Source. Open Code.
<br />

## Why Deepcrawl exists
- Compress messy web pages into structured markdown that agents and humans can read.
- Map every link in a domain so workflows understand site topology before they browse.
- Offer type-safe, production-ready APIs and SDKs that feel native inside agent frameworks like `ai-sdk`.

## How the system is put together
- **Crawling pipeline:** Cloudflare Workers handle fetching, normalization, and link graph generation for each domain or URL.
- **Rendering outputs:** Engines convert HTML into markdown tuned for LLM prompts, keeping context rich while trimming noise.
- **Developer toolchain:** The monorepo hosts shared packages, database modules, and scripts that keep the full stack consistent.

## Ways to use Deepcrawl today
- **Developers:** Consume the APIs directly or integrate with the fully typed JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs for fast agent workflows.
- **Analysts & teams:** Use the Next.js 15 dashboard to run crawls, explore the API playground, review logs, and manage API keys without writing code.

## Deploy on your own terms
Deepcrawl ships with everything you need to self-host: deploy the dashboard to Vercel, the workers to Cloudflare, and you have a complete system without paid dependencies. Fork it, extend it, or plug it into your existing stackâ€”the licenses and tooling encourage customization.
