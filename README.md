Deepcrawl is an agents-oriented website data context extraction platform. It extracts cleaned markdown of page content, agent-favoured hierarchical links tree and metadata that LLMs can digest with minimal token cost to reduce context switching and hallucination.

> Full Platform (Nextjs Dashboard, API Workers, Auth Workers, and Database) is open and transparent.
