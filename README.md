> NOTE: DeepCrawl doesn’t target anti-scraping or anti-bot purposes. It’s optimized for high‑frequency agent workloads that scrape public pages to extract cleaned Markdown and a hierarchical links tree.

Deepcrawl is an agent-oriented website data context extraction platform. It extracts cleaned markdown of page content, agent-favoured hierarchical links tree, and metadata that LLMs can digest with minimal token cost to reduce context switching and hallucination.


> Full Platform (Nextjs Dashboard, API Workers, Auth Workers, and Database) is open and transparent.
