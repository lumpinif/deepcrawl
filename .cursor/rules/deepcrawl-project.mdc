# Deepcrawl Project Rules

## Package Management
- Never use npm as default package manager - this project uses pnpm.
- Always use pnpm for package management commands in this project.
- Use pnpm or bun according to current project package manager.

## Development Commands
- Never run dev commands for the user (like `pnpm dev`, `pnpm run dev`, etc.) - they will run these themselves.
- Never run build commands for the user unless explicitly requested.
- Remember: The user prefers to control when dev and build processes start.

## Code Style & Framework
- You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, and Tailwind v4 for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.

## Authentication
- Better Auth's client (authClient) includes an unlinkAccount method that accepts a providerId and optional accountId.
- If only one account remains, unlinking will fail unless allowUnlinkingAll is set to true in the betterAuth configuration.
